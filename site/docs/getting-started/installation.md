## Installing Fusuma

Fusuma requires Node >= 8.x.

```sh
$ npm i fusuma -D # yarn fusuma --dev
```

## Procedure

Only a `slides` directory is required by Fusuma.

```sh
$ mkdir slides && echo '# HelloðŸ˜„' > slides/title.md
$ npx fusuma start
$ open http://localhost:8080

# --- Tree ---
$ tree -a
.
â””â”€â”€ slides
    â””â”€â”€ title.md

1 directory, 1 files
```

<br />

As you can see a cool slide was generated.ðŸ˜Ž Fusuma uses [WebSlides](http://webslides.tv) as UI and has a sidebar as a default.
