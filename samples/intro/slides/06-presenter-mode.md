## Presenter Mode

Recommend using this feature if you give a speech.

<br />

Fusuma is compatible with [Presentation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Presentation_API),

but you can also use this mode if you use browsers which don't have Presentation API

because Fusuma can fallback to using localstorage.

---

## Setup

- 1. open Sidebar(click the bottom right button(三))
- 2. click the PC monitor icon
- 3. if you use Chrome, you can choose select cast device
- 4. if you use a browser that does not support Presentation API, a new window will be created
