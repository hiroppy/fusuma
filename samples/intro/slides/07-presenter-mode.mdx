## Presenter Mode

Recommend using this feature if you give a speech.

<br />

Fusuma is compatible with [Presentation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Presentation_API),

but you can also use this mode if you use browsers which don't have Presentation API

because Fusuma can fallback to using localstorage.

<br />

**Since iframes are used internally, recommend that you use this feature in your localhost.**
